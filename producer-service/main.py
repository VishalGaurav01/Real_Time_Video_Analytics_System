Purpose: Read video frames from RTSP stream and send to Kafka

This producer implements the first step of the Optifye video processing pipeline:
1. Connects to an RTSP stream (video source)
2. Captures video frames continuously
3. Publishes each frame individually to Kafka
4. Converts frames to base64 for JSON serialization
5. Sends frames to Kafka topic for downstream processing

Data Flow:
RTSP Stream → Frame Capture → Frame Conversion → Kafka Topic (Individual Frames)

================================================================================
                                DATA FLOW SUMMARY
================================================================================

This RTSP Producer implements the first step of the Optifye video processing pipeline.

DATA FLOW:
RTSP Connection → Frame Capture → Frame Conversion → Kafka Topic (Individual Frames)

DETAILED PROCESS:
1. RTSP Connection → Opens connection to RTSP server (rtsp://65.0.91.177:8554/cam)
2. Frame Capture → Reads frames at 30 FPS continuously using OpenCV
3. Frame Resize → Resizes frames to max 640x480 to reduce size
4. Frame Conversion → Converts each frame to base64 JPEG (20% quality for much smaller messages)
5. Message Creation → Creates JSON with metadata and base64 frame
6. Kafka Publishing → Sends individual frame to Kafka topic (video-frames) with GZIP compression

MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
{
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123,           # When frame was captured
    "frame_id": 12345,                     # Sequential frame identifier
    "frame_data": "base64_frame_data",     # Base64 encoded frame (resized, low quality)
    "source": "rtsp://65.0.91.177:8554/cam" # Source RTSP stream
}

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Frame Size: Resized to max 640x480 (maintains aspect ratio)
- JPEG Quality: 20% (much smaller file size)
- Compression: GZIP enabled on Kafka producer
- Message Size: ~10-30 KB per frame (down from 2MB+)
- Frame Rate: ~30 FPS
- Publishing: Individual frames, no batching
- Ordering: Maintained by frame_id sequence

KAFKA PRODUCER CONFIGURATION:
- max_request_size: 10MB (handles larger messages)
- compression_type: gzip (reduces network traffic)
- batch_size: 16KB (smaller batches)
- linger_ms: 100ms (batch timing)
- buffer_memory: 32MB (larger buffer)
- retries: 3 (handle temporary failures)
- acks: 1 (leader acknowledgment)

RETRY MECHANISM:
- RTSP Connection: 3 attempts with 5-second delays
- Frame Reading: Continuous retry on failure
- Kafka Publishing: 10-second timeout per message

UTILITY FUNCTIONS:
- resize_frame(): Resize frames to reduce message size
- frame_to_base64(): Convert single frame to base64 (20% quality)
- create_frame_message(): Create Kafka message structure for single frame
- connect_rtsp_with_retry(): Connect to RTSP with retry mechanism
- save_frame_as_image(): Save a single frame as an image file

MODULAR STRUCTURE:
- main.py: Core RTSP producer logic and Kafka integration
- utils.py: Reusable utility functions for frame processing
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies
- .env: Configuration file (optional)

ADVANTAGES OF OPTIMIZED INDIVIDUAL FRAME PUBLISHING:
✅ Much smaller messages (~10-30 KB vs 2MB+)
✅ GZIP compression reduces network traffic
✅ No data loss - Each frame immediately persisted
✅ Real-time processing - No delay waiting for batch
✅ Better fault tolerance - Process crash = Loss of 1 frame, not 25
✅ Scalable - Multiple consumers can process same frames
✅ Memory efficient - No large buffers in producer
✅ Solves message size issue - Individual frames are much smaller

PIPELINE STATUS TILL NOW:
✅ RTSP Server: Running and streaming
✅ Kafka Server: Running and accepting messages
✅ Producer: Optimized individual frame publishing 
⏳ Consumer: Next to implement (will handle batching)
⏳ Inference: Next to implement
⏳ Post-processor: Next to implement
⏳ EKS Cluster: Next to set up
