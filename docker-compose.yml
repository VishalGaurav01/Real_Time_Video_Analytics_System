# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What does "env_file" do?
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "env_file" directive loads environment variables from the specified file
# and injects them into the container at runtime. This is useful for keeping
# secrets and configuration out of your Dockerfile and version control.
#
# Example: If ./consumer/.env contains "KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092", then
# inside the consumer container, the environment variable KAFKA_BROKERS will be set.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Difference between "env_file" and "environment":
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - "env_file": Loads variables from a file (good for many variables, secrets, .env files)
# - "environment": Lets you specify variables inline in the compose file, like:
#     environment:
#       - KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092
#       - KAFKA_TOPIC=video-frames
#
# You can use both together; "environment" overrides variables from "env_file" if both are set.
